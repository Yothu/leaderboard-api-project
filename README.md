## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

You need to be able to use Node Package Manager, or also called, the `npm` command.
If you dont have it, install it with these commands in the CLI (for Linux):

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -`

`sudo apt install nodejs`

Then, run this command in the CLI:

`npm --version`

If the previous command prints a single line with a version number on screen, `npm` was installed.

After you are inside, download the `npm` dependecies with this command:
